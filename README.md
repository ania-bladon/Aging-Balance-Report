# Aging Balance Report using Excel and Power Query

The goal of this report is to combine data from two sources, SAP and Salesforce, so as to provide a single comprehensive report which is cleaned and transformed in Power Query.

The data columns in this report were insipred by a real Aging Balance Report, but all data is AI generated and entirely fake.
